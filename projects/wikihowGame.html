    <a href='https://github.com/Rock-it-science/wikihow-game'>Wikihow Game</a>
    <p>A party game where you get to caption WihiHow pictures.<br>
    The index screen displays the buttons to allow selection of host of player.</p>
    <img id='sampleCap' src='wikihow/index.png'/>
    <p>The guess/player page displays a text entry box to allow players to
    submit responses.</p>
    <img id='sampleCap' src='wikihow/player.png'/>
    <p>The code for this page is very simple, and consists of a simple HTML
    form that submits to a php file called responseSubmit.<br>
    The responsSubmit file simply submits the response from the HTML form to the
    mySQL server. Its really about as simple as a database interaction can get.
    I ran my server with XAMPP using MariaDB and PHP 7.3.10<br>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/Rock-it-science/014b7fba5f683a40be2882540ac98581.js?file=responseSubmit.php"></script>
    The picture/host page displays an image, and a timer. While the timer
    is counting down, submissions are entered by the players.</p>
    <img id='sampleCap' src='wikihow/host1.png'/>
    <p>Once the timer has reached 0, the submissions collected from the players
    as well as the original caption are displayed on-screen.</p>
