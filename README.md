A party game where you get to caption WihiHow pictures

This game is designed to be played much like other party games where you have a host computer (often hooked up to a TV), and a bunch of players on their phones that enter in funny titles for the picture dispalyed on the host's screen.

Credit to damn.dog for inspiration, and I also copied their folder of images that they ripped from Wikihow, because apparently its harder than it sounds to actually rip a random image from a website and garuntee that it won't be a logo, not to mention most of the photos on there are pretty mundain, and damn.dog seemed to pick the interesting ones.
